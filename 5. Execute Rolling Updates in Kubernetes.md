# Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image `nginx:1.19` with the latest updates.

Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the `nginx:1.19` image. The deployment is named `nginx-deployment`.

Ensure all pods are operational post-update.


## Step 1 — Perform the rolling update

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.19
```

Check container name: 

```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml | grep name:
```

## Step 2 — Monitor the rolling update

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

## Step 3 — Verify pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```
