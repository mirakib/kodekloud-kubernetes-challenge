# Resolve VolumeMounts Issue in Kubernetes

We encountered an issue with our Nginx and PHP-FPM setup on the Kubernetes cluster this morning, which halted its functionality. Investigate and rectify the issue:


The pod name is `nginx-phpfpm` and configmap name is `nginx-config`. Identify and fix the problem.

Once resolved, copy `/home/thor/index.php` file from the `jump host` to the `nginx-container` within the nginx document root. After this, you should be able to access the website using Website button on the top bar.

**Fix volume mount:**

```sh
kubectl edit pod nginx-phpfpm
```

Change this line `- mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html`  to this `- mountPath: /var/www/html` for `- image: nginx:latest`

**Copy `index.php` file to the container:**
```sh
kubectl cp index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html/index.php -c nginx-container
```
