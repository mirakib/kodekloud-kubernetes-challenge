# Deploy Applications with Kubernetes Deployments

The Nautilus DevOps team is delving into Kubernetes for app management. One team member needs to create a deployment following these details:

Create a deployment named `httpd` to deploy the application `httpd` using the image `httpd:latest` (ensure to specify the tag)

Note: The kubectl utility on `jump_host` is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.


**`httpd-deployment.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: httpd:latest
```

## Apply deployment

```yaml
kubectl apply -f httpd-deployment.yaml
```

## Verify deployment

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods -l app=httpd
