# Create Countdown Job in Kubernetes

The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:

- Create a job named `countdown-devops`.

- The spec template should be named `countdown-devops` (under metadata), and the container should be named `container-countdown-devops`

- Utilize image `debian` with `latest` tag (ensure to specify as `debian:latest`), and set the restart policy to `Never`.

- Execute the command `sleep 5`


**`countdown-devops.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-devops
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-devops
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: container-countdown-devops
          image: debian:latest
          command: ["sleep", "5"]
```

### Apply the job

```bash
kubectl apply -f countdown-devops.yaml
```

### Verify the job

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```
Check the Pod created by the Job

```bash
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=countdown-nautilus
```

Find the pod with a name like: `countdown-devops-xxxxx`
